# Currently Playing Games Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a "Currently Playing" games feature that allows users to track games they're actively playing, separate from completed reviews. Users can track multiple games simultaneously and convert them to full reviews when finished.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- **New Models:**
  - `CurrentlyPlaying`: Main model for tracking games in progress
    - Fields: id, userId, gameId, platform, startDate, playTimeHours, notes, createdAt, updatedAt
    - Relations: User (many-to-one), Game (many-to-one), Screenshots (one-to-many)
  - `CurrentlyPlayingScreenshot`: Screenshots for currently playing entries
    - Fields: id, currentlyPlayingId, url, caption, uploadedAt
    - Relation: CurrentlyPlaying (many-to-one)

- **Migration:** Successfully created and applied migration `20251031032957_add_currently_playing`

### 2. API Routes
Created comprehensive API endpoints:

- **`/api/currently-playing`**

- **`/api/currently-playing/[id]`**
  - GET: Fetch single entry
  - PATCH: Update entry (requires ownership)
  - DELETE: Delete entry (requires ownership)

### 5. Navigation Updates

#### Updated `components/navbar.tsx`
