# Delete Review Feature

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the delete review functionality for the Beat-n-Yeat-v2 application.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Backend API Endpoint
The DELETE endpoint already existed at `/api/reviews/[id]/route.ts` with the following features:
- **Authentication**: Requires user to be logged in
- **Authorization**: Only the review owner can delete their review
- **Cascade Delete**: Automatically deletes associated screenshots and save files (configured in Prisma schema)
- **Error Handling**: Returns appropriate HTTP status codes (401, 403, 404, 500)

### 2. Delete Review Button Component
**File**: `components/delete-review-button.tsx`

A reusable client component that provides:
- Delete button with trash icon
- Confirmation dialog before deletion
- Loading state during deletion
- Automatic redirect after successful deletion
- Error handling with user feedback

**Props**:
- `reviewId`: The ID of the review to delete
- `redirectPath`: Where to redirect after deletion (default: "/")

### 3. Review Detail Page Integration
**File**: `app/reviews/[id]/page.tsx`

Enhanced the review detail page to:
- Check if the current user is the review owner
- Display the delete button only for the owner
- Position the button next to the rating display
- Redirect to home page after deletion

### 4. Profile Page Integration
**File**: `app/profile/[userId]/page.tsx`

Enhanced the profile page to show delete buttons on review cards:
- Check if the user is viewing their own profile
- Use `ReviewCardWithActions` component for own reviews
- Use standard `ReviewCard` for viewing other users' profiles

### 5. Review Card with Actions Component
**File**: `components/review-card-with-actions.tsx`

A new client component that extends the review card functionality:
- Displays a delete button on hover (top-right corner)
- Shows confirmation dialog before deletion
- Refreshes the page after successful deletion
- Prevents navigation when clicking the delete button
- Maintains all original review card features

## User Experience

### On Review Detail Page
1. User views their own review
2. Delete button appears next to the rating
3. Clicking opens a confirmation dialog
4. After confirmation, review is deleted
5. User is redirected to the home page

### On Profile Page
1. User views their own profile
2. Each review card shows a delete button on hover
3. Clicking opens a confirmation dialog
4. After confirmation, review is deleted
5. Page refreshes to show updated list

## Security Features

1. **Authentication Check**: All delete operations require a valid session
2. **Authorization Check**: Only the review owner can delete their review
3. **Server-Side Validation**: Authorization is checked on the server, not just the client
4. **Cascade Delete**: Related data (screenshots, save files) are automatically cleaned up

## Database Schema
The Prisma schema already includes cascade delete relationships:

```prisma
model Review {
  // ... fields
  screenshots   Screenshot[]
  saveFile      SaveFile?
}

model Screenshot {
  review     Review   @relation(fields: [reviewId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
}

model SaveFile {
  review     Review   @relation(fields: [reviewId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
}
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test as review owner**:
   - Create a review
   - Navigate to the review detail page
   - Verify delete button appears
   - Delete the review and verify redirect

2. **Test on profile page**:
   - View your own profile
   - Hover over review cards
   - Verify delete button appears
   - Delete a review and verify page refresh

3. **Test as non-owner**:
   - View another user's review
   - Verify delete button does NOT appear
   - Attempt direct API call (should return 403)

4. **Test unauthenticated**:
   - Log out
   - View any review
   - Verify delete button does NOT appear
   - Attempt direct API call (should return 401)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Add "Edit" functionality alongside delete
2. Add undo/restore functionality (soft delete)
3. Add bulk delete on profile page
4. Add admin ability to delete any review
5. Add confirmation with review title/game name
6. Add toast notifications instead of alerts

## Files Modified

1. `components/delete-review-button.tsx` (new)
2. `components/review-card-with-actions.tsx` (new)
3. `app/reviews/[id]/page.tsx` (modified)
4. `app/profile/[userId]/page.tsx` (modified)

## Dependencies

No new dependencies were added. The implementation uses:
- Next.js App Router
- NextAuth for authentication
- Prisma for database operations
- Existing UI components (Dialog, Button, etc.)
